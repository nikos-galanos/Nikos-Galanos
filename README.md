### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a current graduate student studying data science at MIT (graduating in August 2023).

I come from a Management Information Systems background from Athens University of Economics and Business, with 3 years of work experience in Telecommunications and Consulting. My experience is always withing the intersection of business and technology, so I am interested in applications of data analysis, machine learning and AI that help improve business outcomes!

Some of the projects I have worked on include:
- Predicting the outcome of a bank's marketing campaign (Python / Julia, partner Ahmad Hussain) 
- Decoding Tweets to predict the outcome of US Midterm Elections 2022 (Python, partner Arushi Jain / Anant Vashistha)
- Exploring employee attrition using HR Analytics (SQL, Tableau)

Feel free to check out my portfolio!

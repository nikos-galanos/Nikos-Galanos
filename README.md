### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a Data Scientist for a major telecommunications company. 

Two years ago I graduated from the Master of Business Analytics at MIT (Class of '23) where I studied extensively courses related to Machine Learning, Optimization and Analytics.

Prior to moving to the United States I worked for ~3.5 years in Telecommunications and Consulting. My experience has always been within the intersection of business and technology, so I am interested in applications of data science, machine learning and AI that help improve business outcomes!

Some of the projects I have worked on outside of my job include:

- Predicting Customer Churn Outcome for a telecommunications company using Supervised Machine Learning Models
- Predicting the outcome of a bank's marketing campaign (Python / Julia, partner Ahmad Hussain) 
- Decoding Tweets to predict the outcome of US Midterm Elections 2022 (Python, partner Arushi Jain / Anant Vashistha)
- Wordle Tweets Analytics (Python)
- Exploring employee attrition using HR Analytics (SQL, Tableau)
